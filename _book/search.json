    "text": "A Global Trend: Cities Committed to Values-Based Food Policy\nThe policies that inform how cities purchase food provide critical opportunities to drive regional resilience and positively impact a region’s economic and environmental goals. To be effective, food policy plans require consideration of local conditions. What works for one city may not work for another. Production systems associated with generating positive environmental impacts are not automatically transferable to other locations; their impacts may vary depending on numerous factors, ranging from microclimates and soil types to transportation and distribution-related infrastructure.\nAs regions across the world leverage public food procurement to meet a combination of climate, health, community development, and economic goals, these policies and programs need to be aware of the trade-offs and co-benefits their policies and programs will create. Having more robust data about the economic, environmental, and social-cultural tradeoffs of the program can help bolster support to implement good food policies.\nThe City Food Policy Project brings together researchers, policy practitioners, and food systems stakeholders to:\n\nUnderstand the impacts, or potential tradeoffs, associated with city food policies\nDevelop policy instruments that inform how cities weigh and implement values-based food policies\n\nThis book contains information and links to all of the data used in this project as well as all project outputs. The goal is to create a framework for our research to be reproducible and to be used to conduct similar research in other cities across the world.\nThe chapters in the book are arranged…",

    "text": "3.1.1 Dry beans\nTo understand cost of production for New York bean producers, we use data from interviews conducted of New York bean producers, which estimate a cost of production of $525 per acre.\nWe also need a cost of production for bean producers outside of New York, as those are the producers currently supplying the New York City beans. Based on discussions with Michael, most of the beans come from North Dakota, so we base our cost of production on an enterprise budget from North Dakota. We also include the other crop budgets we could find for comparison/to provide range:\n\nNorth Dakota, 2024\n\nCost per acre: $434.05\n\nWyoming\n\nCost per acre: $598.70, cost per CWT $23.95\n\nColorado\n\nCost per acre: $454.57, cost per CWT $113.64\n\nTexas\n\nCost per acre: $400\n\n\nConclusions We will use the cost of production data from New York combined with Census of Agriculture data to estimate cost of production for different types of operations. For those outside of NY, we will provide a range based on the enterprise budgets we were able to find.\nFrom the Census of Agriculture, we have an average dry bean yield in NY of 20.5 CWT per acre to convert to production cost per lb.\nThe New York cost of production per acre is based on June’s assumption.\n\n3.1.1.1 NYS producers\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(openxlsx)\n\nny_production_cost_acre &lt;- 525\nny_production_cost_acre_se &lt;- 0.25*ny_production_cost_acre\n\n# Import fake data\ndrybeans &lt;- read_xlsx(\n  \"data_raw/coa_cost_per_acre.xlsx\", \n  sheet = \"drybeans\")\n\n# Add production cost per acre for beans from crop budget\ndrybeans &lt;- drybeans %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    year = 2024,\n    baseline = ny_production_cost_acre, \n    baseline_se = ny_production_cost_acre_se,\n    production_cost_acre_mean = baseline + \n      (baseline*percent_diff_mean), \n    production_cost_acre_se =  baseline_se + \n      (baseline_se*percent_diff_se) \n    )\n\n# Rename to be consistent with other spreadsheet\ndrybeans &lt;- drybeans %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    variable_name = case_when(\n      mwbe_fct==\"Not MWBE\" & \n        sales_class_agg == \"GCFI $1M or more\" & \n        organic_fct == \"No organic sales\" ~ \n        \"cost_of_production_drybean_more_mill_nonmwbe_conv\", \n      mwbe_fct==\"MWBE\" & \n        sales_class_agg == \"GCFI $1M or more\" & \n        organic_fct == \"No organic sales\" ~\n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_more_mill_mwbe_conv\",\n      mwbe_fct==\"Not MWBE\" & \n        sales_class_agg == \"GCFI less than $1M\" & \n        organic_fct == \"No organic sales\" ~ \n        \"cost_of_production_drybean_less_mill_nonmwbe_conv\", \n      mwbe_fct==\"MWBE\" & \n        sales_class_agg == \"GCFI less than $1M\" & \n        organic_fct == \"No organic sales\" ~ \n        \"cost_of_production_drybean_less_mill_mwbe_conv\", \n      mwbe_fct==\"Not MWBE\" & \n        sales_class_agg == \"GCFI less than $1M\" & \n        organic_fct == \"Organic sales\" ~\n        \"cost_of_production_drybean_less_mill_nonmwbe_org\")\n  ) \n\n# Keep only data we need\ndrybeans &lt;- drybeans %&gt;% \n  select(variable_name,\n         production_cost_acre_mean, production_cost_acre_se) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(variable_name))\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Outside NYS producers\n\nNorth Dakota: 434.05\nWyoming: 598.70\nColorado: 454.57\nTexas: 400\n\n\n# Calculate mean and se from the data that we have\noutside_ny &lt;- tibble(\n  location = c(\"North Dakota\", \"Wyoming\", \"Colorado\", \"Texas\"), \n  cost_acre = c(434.05, 598.70, 454.57, 400)\n)\n\n# Calulate mean and standard error and include as vectors\nmean &lt;- outside_ny %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean = mean(cost_acre)) %&gt;% \n  pull()\n\nse &lt;- outside_ny %&gt;% \n  summarise(sd = sd(cost_acre), \n            n = n(), \n            se = sd/sqrt(n)) %&gt;% \n  pull(se)\n\ndrybeans &lt;- drybeans %&gt;% \n  add_row(\n    variable_name = \"cost_of_production_drybean_outsideNY\", \n    production_cost_acre_mean = mean, \n    production_cost_acre_se = se)\n\n\n# ADD in N/As for options not included \nnames &lt;- tibble(\n  variable_name = \n    c(\"cost_of_production_drybean_more_mill_nonmwbe_conv\",\n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_more_mill_mwbe_conv\",\n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_less_mill_nonmwbe_conv\", \n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_less_mill_mwbe_conv\", \n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_more_mill_nonmwbe_org\",\n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_more_mill_mwbe_org\", \n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_less_mill_nonmwbe_org\", \n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_less_mill_mwbe_org\", \n      \"cost_of_production_drybean_outsideNY\")\n)\n\n# Join \ndrybeans &lt;- left_join(names, drybeans)\n\nrm(names)\n\n# Add in $ per hectare (1 hectare) = 2.471 acres)\ndrybeans &lt;- drybeans %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    production_cost_hectare_mean = production_cost_acre_mean*2.471, \n    production_cost_hectare_se = production_cost_acre_se*2.471\n  )\n\nrm(outside_ny)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Soybeans\nWe use Census of Agriculture data and keep only those producers with soybean sales.

Note there are no purchases of beans from MWBE businesses in the data.\nFull set of summary statistics includes mean and standard deviation of price per lb. and per kg. by year, agency, and form (canned, dried).\n\n# Drop data without a weight\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  filter(\n    `Total Weight in lbs`!=0)\n\n# Remove outliers that are more than 2 SD from the mean\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  group_by(Agency, `Time Period`, Form) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    mean_lb = mean(`Price per lb`, na.rm = TRUE), \n    sd_lb = sd(`Price per lb`, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    outlier = case_when(\n      `Price per lb` &lt; mean_lb - 2*sd_lb |  \n        `Price per lb` &gt; mean_lb + 2*sd_lb ~ 1, \n      TRUE ~ 0)\n    ) %&gt;% \n  filter(outlier==0) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  select(-mean_lb, -sd_lb)\n \n# Drop purchases that are local (note there are no MWBE businesses)\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  filter(`NY State spend y/n`==\"N\")\n  \n# Summary stats with outliers removed \nsum &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  group_by(Agency, `Time Period`, Form) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    mean_lb = mean(`Price per lb`, na.rm = TRUE), \n    sd_lb = sd(`Price per lb`, na.rm = TRUE), \n    mean_kg = mean(`Price per kg`, na.rm = TRUE), \n    sd_kg = sd(`Price per kg`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n# Add worksheet\naddWorksheet(wb, \"NYC_bean_purchasing\")\nwriteData(wb, \"NYC_bean_purchasing\", sum)\n\n# Info\ninfo &lt;- tibble(\n  sheet_name = c(\n    \"NYC_bean_purchasing\"), \n  description = c(\n    \"Mean and standard deviation of price/lb. and price/kg. for beans by agency, year, and form (e.g, dried, canned, frozen)\", \n  source = \"NYC dashboard\", \n  url = \"https://www.nyc.gov/site/foodpolicy/good-food-purchasing/citywidedata.page\",\n  notes = \"Includes only purchases from outside of New York and not from MWBE businesses (i.e., no premiums associated with local/MWBE attributes included in the data).\")\n)\n\n# Add Worksheet\naddWorksheet(wb, \"info\")\nwriteData(wb, \"info\", info)\n\n# Save \nsaveWorkbook(wb, \"data_final/NYC_bean_purchasing.xlsx\", \n             overwrite = TRUE)\n\n\n# Keep data per lb. and for 2022 only\ntable &lt;- sum %&gt;% \n  filter(`Time Period`==2022) %&gt;%\n  select(-c(`Time Period`, mean_kg:last_col())) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    sd_lb = case_when(\n      is.na(sd_lb) ~ 0, \n      TRUE ~ sd_lb\n  )) %&gt;% \n  rename(\n    Mean = mean_lb, \n    SD = sd_lb\n  ) \n\ntable %&gt;% \n  kable(\n    digits = 2, \n    caption = '&lt;span style=\"color: black; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\"&gt;Price per pound for dried and canned beans purchased by New York City in 2022&lt;/span&gt;') %&gt;%\n  kable_styling()\n\n\nPrice per pound for dried and canned beans purchased by New York City in 2022\n\n\nAgency\nForm\nMean\nSD\n\n\n\n\nAdministration for Children's Services\nCanned\n0.46\n0.02\n\n\nAdministration for Children's Services\nDried\n1.48\n0.28\n\n\nDepartment for the Aging\nCanned\n0.81\n0.42\n\n\nDepartment of Correction\nDried\n1.26\n0.50\n\n\nDepartment of Education\nCanned\n0.47\n0.21\n\n\nDepartment of Homeless Services\nCanned\n0.65\n0.09\n\n\nDepartment of Homeless Services\nDried\n1.32\n0.39\n\n\nHealth + Hospitals\nCanned\n0.72\n0.08\n\n\nHealth + Hospitals\nDried\n1.31\n0.28",

    "text": "Land - Land is used as a production import for growing crops as well as for drive rows and buildings.\nLabor - Both hired and family labor is used to produce dry beans.\nFarm Inputs - These include seeds, fertilizer, chemical inputs, machinery, gasoline, and custom hired processes for production (for example: renting a no-till drill for planting)\nFarm Production - The act of growing the product on-farm. From planting to harvesting. This does not include cleaning or bagging.\nCleaner Aggregator - A business that cleans and sorts dry beans. They can be owned by a farm or a cooperative of a group of farms. They can also be independent of any production. They often purchase by truckload and sell in smaller quantities (25 or 100 pound units) or sell by container for beans headed to export markets. They operate by either buying the harvested beans and selling them once cleaned or by charging a fee for cleaning and storage. The focus group will illuminate which is more common in New York.\nOn Farm Cleaning/Sorting/Packing - Often classified as an independent business for insurance purposes, these operations will clean, sort, and pack the beans they grow.\nPrimary Processor - This includes businesses that use the cleaned beans as the input. Examples include canning beans, creating bean flour, and automated packaging into retail bags.\nSecondary Processor - This is a secondary stage of processing beans into products. These use beans from primary processors as inputs into their products. These include using cooked beans or bean flour to create a new product.\nWholesale - A business selling a product made by someone else. They can sell items from various stages of the supply chain.\nDropship/ Broker - A business that facilitates the sales of beans but never physically takes control of the products they are selling.\nExport Markets - Selling beans to international markets. Often through the port in Toronto.\nInstitutions - A purchaser of bean products from various sources. They often buy multiple products in large quantities through a wholesaler.\nRetail - Businesses that sell to consumers. These include grocery stores, food businesses that sell to consumers, and restaurants.\nConsumer - Individuals who purchase bean products for immediate consumption (from restaurants) or for home use.",
