We use [USDA NASS Crop values for Field and Miscellaneous Crops 2022-2024](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/cpvl0225.pdf). I could not find data for New York specifically, [2019-2021](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/k35694332/gb19g8865/jd474051x/cpvl0222.pdf), [2017-2018](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/cpvl0220.pdf), and [2014-2016](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/k35694332/5425kd763/st74dn630/CropValuSu-02-24-2017.pdf).
