<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Food purchasing and consumption choices play a central role not only in the individual health of people, but also the economic, social, and environmental wellbeing of society. Beyond nutrition’s role in public health, food impacts the environment through its production, processing, and transportation, all of which significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, soil, water, and air quality. Additionally, over 10 percent of U.S. employment is in food and agriculture sectors, and labor practices in these industries play important roles in the economic well-being of people and communities that rely on those jobs. Because food impacts so many aspects of our lives, cities around the world are beginning to leverage their public food procurement dollars to influence food system transformation. Among these cities, New York City (NYC) has a large share of municipal food procurement, spending about $500 million per year on food and meals for public agencies, including schools, correctional facilities, hospitals, older adult centers, pantries, shelters, and more.</p>
<p>Due to the scale of NYC’s food procurement and the potential public value of food systems change, NYC is developing plans for values-based procurement policies that will help the city to leverage its food spending towards a variety of public goals. In 2018, NYC worked with the Center for Good Food Purchasing to conduct a baseline assessment of public procurement and set a path forward for agencies to adopt the GFP framework, while adapting it to the NYC reality. Later, in 2021, NYC MOFP released Food Forward NYC, the city’s first ever 10-year food policy plan. The plan includes the goal of using food purchasing to advance values including transparency, local economies, environmental sustainability, valued workforce, animal welfare, and nutrition. Finally, in 2022, through an executive order, NYC institutionalized these efforts, as a way to foster vendor and agency cooperation in improving health and nutrition through public food procurement and the NYC food standards.</p>
<p>Using public spending to advance broader public goals beyond the direct intent of the expenditure is not a new practice. In recent decades, practices such as divestment from fossil fuel companies have grown in popularity as a way to meet the direct needs of the purchasing entity but also the needs of the broader public. Values-based food procurement, however, represents a significant advancement in the use and impact of such procurement mechanisms for advancing social change. Public food procurement is governed by critical federal, state, and local laws that guide – and sometimes limit – how public dollars can be spent. These policies, guidelines, and regulations are meant to ensure that public dollars are spent responsibly and in ways that limit graft and corruption. Barring any legislative changes, effective values-based food procurement policies must be enacted within the legal framework of existing laws and policies.</p>
<p>Starting in 2023, NYC partnered with researchers at Colorado State University (CSU) and Cornell University on the City Food Policy Project (CFP Project) to empirically model the impacts of potential values-based procurement policies. The project aims to model a select number of values-based procurement policies and their potential, social, environmental, and economic implications for both NYC and New York State.</p>
<p>This report aims to enumerate the legal and political setting of the CFP Project in three sections. First, we summarize the proposed values-based procurement policies that are under consideration by NYC and the process by which these policies were selected. Second, we review key federal, New York State, and New York City laws and policies that influence municipal food procurement. Finally, we review each values-based procurement policy under consideration and specific laws and policies that guide their implementation. This report is an enumeration of relevant laws and policies and not an analysis of those laws. Moreover, this report does not represent the formal or legal opinion of the City of New York.</p>

<section id="guiding-values" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guiding-values">Guiding Values</h4>
<p>Cities have begun to leverage their part of this spending to advance impacts both for their residents and their regions. The values guiding NYC’s food procurement policies are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal welfare. NYC aims to use public food dollars to minimize harm to animals raised for food.</li>
<li>Environmental sustainability. NYC aims to use public food dollars to support a healthy and sustainable natural environment.</li>
<li>Local economies. NYC aims to use public food dollars to support New York State businesses, particularly those that are owned by women and minorities.</li>
<li>Nutrition. NYC aims to use its public food dollars on nutritionally dense foods like minimally processed vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</li>
<li>Transparency. NYC aims to provide transparency in what food it is buying, where this food is coming from, and who provides this food.</li>
<li>Valued workforce. NYC aims to use its public food dollars to support businesses and supply chains that support the wellbeing of the workers and employees.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="policy-actions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-actions">Policy Actions</h4>
<p>In support of these values, NYC – in collaboration with research partners at CSU and Cornell – identified six procurement policies for the research team to investigate. These policy actions were selected that could be administratively or legally feasible for NYC, align with existing Mayoral priorities, and have the potential of advancing the values outlined previously. The research team will work to model the social, environmental, and economic implications of adopting these policies, with particular attention to their impacts on the guiding values listed above. These actions are summarized below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Price premium or purchasing requirement for USDA-certified Organic foods and food products (“Organic preference”)</em></strong>. Under this policy, NYC would incorporate Organic status into the evaluation of best value bids and solicitations, awarding extra points to certified organic products that fall within10 percent of the lowest bid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Price premium or purchasing requirement for grown and/or processed in New York State (“local preference”)</em></strong>. Under this policy, NYC agencies would incorporate local status into the evaluation of best value bids, awarding extra points to products from New York State that fall within 10 percent of the lowest bid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Price premium or purchasing requirement for proposals from companies that engage in community hiring (“community hiring preference”)</em></strong>. Under this policy, NYC would evaluate bids or solicitations from small businesses and/or companies employing a substantial percentage of economically disadvantaged candidates as if those bids were 10 percent lower than their submitted bid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Price premium or purchasing requirement for proposals from companies that are certified minority and women-owned business enterprises (“MWBE preference”)</em></strong>. Under this current policy, NYC can evaluate best value bids or solicitations from companies that are certified as a Minority- or Women-Owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) as if those bids were 10 percent lower than their submitted bid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Public investments in middle food supply chain infrastructure (“Infrastructure investments”)</em></strong>. Under this policy, NYC and/or NY State would provide direct public investments in supply chain infrastructure, such as processing and cold storage sites in the city or region. Investments could take the form of direct grants, loans, and/or technical assistance.<br>
</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Increasing the percentage of plant-based proteins and fruits and vegetables in agency-provided meals and food (“Menu changes”)</em></strong>. Under this policy, NYC would require changes to agency menus that would result in increased purchases of fruits, vegetables, and/or plant based proteins.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections begin by reviewing relevant laws/policies at the Federal, state, and city levels that are either generally applicable across all proposed policy actions and/or specific to a given policy action. Table 1 summarizes all laws/policies reviewed in this document and associated policy actions that may be impacted by each.</p>

<section id="key-considerations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-considerations">Key Considerations</h4>
<p>This summary outlines legal and policy factors influencing the implementation of current and potential values-based procurement policies by the City of New York. In this final section, we outline two key lingering questions: definitions around community hiring and whether the Governor will sign the NYS Good Food Purchasing legislation.</p>
<p>Currently, two features – hiring economically disadvantaged individuals and supporting small businesses – are critical to the enactment of the proposed community hiring policy. State law does provide clarification of what constitutes an economically disadvantaged individual. Furthermore, federal and state law provide guidance on what constitutes a small business according to the Federal Small Business Administration and the State finance law. However, both core concepts require further clarification in order to effectively develop policies that advance these areas in values-based procurement.</p>
<p>Rules governing community hiring that employ the State-definition of economically disadvantaged individual must still go through a formal rule-making process outlined by the City Administrative Procedures Act (CAPA). This rule-making process will be essential to establishing actionable criteria and processes needed for implementation. Additionally, the public comment process may result in legal/political challenges to the proposed rules that may necessitate further revision to the definition, criteria, and processes. Similarly, while the Federal Small Business Administration and State finance law provide definitions of small business, these definitions are intended for business support programs and taxation and the definitions of small business may not be relevant to food procurement decision making. For example, the maximum of 300 employees noted in the State definition of small business is likely too high to provide useful guidance to procurement decisions seeking to support relevant small- and mid-scale farms. Industry-specific guidance on what constitutes a small business will be needed. In addition to these definitional clarifications under the community hiring policy proposal, further clarification is also needed regarding how these characteristics – community hiring and small business – will be weighed/considered when scoring product/service bids and proposals.</p>
