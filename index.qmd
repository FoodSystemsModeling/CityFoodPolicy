## A Global trend: Cities committed to values-based food policy

The policies that inform how cities purchase food provide critical opportunities to drive regional resilience and positively impact a region’s economic and environmental goals. To be effective, food policy plans require consideration of local conditions. What works for one city may not work for another. Production systems associated with generating positive environmental impacts are not automatically transferable to other locations; their impacts may vary depending on numerous factors, ranging from microclimates and soil types to transportation and distribution-related infrastructure.

As regions across the world leverage public food procurement to meet a combination of climate, health, community development, and economic goals, these policies and programs need to be aware of the trade-offs and co-benefits their policies and programs will create. Having more robust data about the economic, environmental, and social-cultural tradeoffs of the program can help bolster support to implement good food policies.

[The City Food Policy Project](https://www.cityfoodpolicy.com/) brings together researchers, policy practitioners, and food systems stakeholders to:

-   Understand the impacts, or potential tradeoffs, associated with city food policies
-   Develop policy instruments that inform how cities weigh and implement values-based food policies

This book contains information and links to all of the data used in this project as well as all project outputs. The goal is to create a framework for our research to be reproducible and to be used to conduct similar research in other cities across the world.
